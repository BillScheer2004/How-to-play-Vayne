        <p>Vaynes earlygame is stronger because of her range which means she can poke her opponent. This is not like in the botlane where you get poked and you wait to scale.
            You need to get ahead because you will play on the sidelane 1v1ing and 1v2ing. You also have to be carefull with pushing enemy wave because your enemies will gank a vayne (you are very targeteble).
            If you can you should hol the wave under your tower and poke your enemy until you can kill him.

        <p>In the lategame Vayne get more broken this is where you will push alot and you need to limit test alot when you get better you will be able to consistently get better at 2v1ing and you will pull alot of pressior for your team.
            also in the midgame if enemy is meele you hit the tower as they stant under it. If they go for farm you need to make sure you hit them and save your E if enemy jgl comes.
            As you are 1v2ing you try to make sure that your team wins because they are 3v4 and you should win more then you lose.
